Topics:

  1. Working with Forms & basic data processing in reactjs
    Please refer src/Profile.jsx for form handling using useState

    Next Session: We will use Formik Package
  
  2. ref in react

      useRef() --> hook used to access the DOM element

      ref.current === e.target ( very similar ) 

      **ref.current/e.target cannot be used to change/alter the contents of the DOM / DOM**
      should be used only for actions on the DOM Elements of application,

      1. Scrolling 
      2. Sliding
      3. Play an audio
      4. Stop an audio
      5. Resetting a form

      ** Ref should not be used to alter the DOM, it should only be used to do actions like above **

      https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef

      Legacy One:
      
        createRef( creates a new reference everytime ) --> does the same thing as useRef but sometimes loses the reference if the component or the jsx is re-rendering

      always try to useRef hook
  
  3. useReducer

      **reducer** is single function which can do multiple things using a set of instructions

      Handling Multiple different state values with single function

      Advanced version of useState:

        it can be used when we change the same state with more than three actions
